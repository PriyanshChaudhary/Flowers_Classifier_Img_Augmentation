# Flowers_Classifier_Img_Augmentation
Using Image augmentation &amp; dropout to solve the issue of over-fitting and classify the type of flower present in the data.
Overfitting can be caused by having a very small amount of training dataset and hence leading to a drastical decrease in the 
accuracy of the model.

# Image augmentation:
It can be defined as performing a number of augmentation actions on the images. These actions include resizing, rotation, zooming 
of images to increase the number of training dataset samples and in turn improve the output accuracy of the machine learning model.
increasing the usage of data analysis
